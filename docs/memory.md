# Memory plane

Owns ingest, entity anchoring, rule extraction/compilation, and the
connector interface (`memory/**`, `connectors/**`). Depends on
`schemas/source_chunk.schema.json`, `memory_item.schema.json`, and
`rule.schema.json`. Breaks if a candidate rule ever gets Cedar text or an
`approved_by` before a human signs it -- that would let ingested text grant
permission, which is the one thing the trust ladder exists to prevent.

## I0 status

- Spike 2 (Bedrock rule extraction) is implemented at
  `spikes/bedrock_rule_extraction_spike.py`, forcing a tool call against the
  closed-vocabulary schema rather than free-text JSON. **Unexecuted**: this
  environment has no AWS credentials, so the "5/5 valid JSON" acceptance
  test (`spikes/test_bedrock_extraction_spike.py`) is skipping honestly
  rather than reporting a result. Re-run it once Person A's AWS bootstrap
  (I0) grants Bedrock Claude access in `us-east-1`.
- Seeded corpus outline: `memory/CORPUS_OUTLINE.md`. Content itself
  (I2 task 11) is not written yet.
